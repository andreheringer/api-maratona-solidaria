# Maratona Solidária

This was a web app implemented for the UFMG Software Development and Processes class. It was engineered and implemented together with [Yasmin Araujo](https://github.com/yasminaraujo), [Ingrid Lagares](https://github.com/ingridlagares), [Herinque Urban](https://github.com/henriqueup) and [Lucas Salles](https://github.com/LucasStarlingdePaulaSalles). Most of the technologies used in the project are standard web stack technologies (A MySQL database with Flask for the back-end, Angular front-end and Docker to bundle everything up and deploy on Azure). The whole project took around 3 months to complete and was divided in three sprints.  The web app was supposed to be used during a charity competition that should’ve happen at 2020 but end up been canceled due to COVID-19.
